So I'm Geoffrey, currently 21, and I'm living in the United States until June. I study Computer Science at SUNY Brockport, while being a French student at Epitech. Studying abroad is a part of my scolarship.

I would describe myself as a polyvalent developer, meaning I can do almost everything within my knowledge without having much issues.

Lately, I've been working on many technologies, such as :
 - NodeJS, AngularJS
 - iOS (Objective C), Android, Windows Phone (C#)
 - C++

I'm currently working on multiple projects:
 - Tilk, a dating application focusing on video instead of written chatting (http://tilk-theapp.com)
 - CELEX Transports, a transport company owned by my godfather. The main purpose is to maintain 2 websites. (http://celex-transports.fr - http://celex-voyageurs.fr)
 - City Warfare, an Epitech project (http://citywarfare.ovh)

This blog will be about most of the stuff I discover while working, and how I resolved most of the issues I may have encountered throughout the development process of some projects.
